Key takeaways.

While working in the tableau file I observed that the number of doctors available in each of the department are less. 
And in Sheet1 we could see that the most of the cases are in the gynaecology department, 
so having sufficient Nurses and doctors according to the required department would make a huge impact.


I could also see that the number of leave applications were very high sometimes and the number of available nurses were 
very less. 
So, creating a well-balanced leave schedule for each of the working staffs would make a huge impact in the time of needs. 
Creating a Leave plan for every year and a monetary reward for staff would boost the staffs to keep working and 
avoid taking on much leave.

From (Sheet 8) we can see that most of the patient are going to the gynecology department. 
Most of the Deposits are in this Department.

I could also see that 
1) Most of the patient have Gynaecology issues,
2) Moderate illness are mostly common in all the departments, and
3) The most cases with Urgent case of admission are also in Genecology department.
